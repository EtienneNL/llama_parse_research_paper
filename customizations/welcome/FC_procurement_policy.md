### Your Trusted Procurement Policy Assistant
Welcome to your go-to tool for navigating the complexities of Procurement policies! Our chatbot aims to streamline your access to critical information, covering everything from Coupa Blueprint, Preferred Supplier Grid to Source-to-Contract SOP.

#### Prototyping Phase
Currently, our chatbot is in its prototype phase. It's being rigorously tested by some of our most data-savvy colleagues to identify improvement areas. The insights gathered will help us refine and perfect the chatbot for a full launch by early September. Your feedback and observations are crucial in this process.

#### Technical Challenges
While Generative AI holds great promise, several technical hurdles remain. We want to ensure you're aware of these challenges as you interact with the chatbot:
- Extracting data from PDFs with embedded tables and images, such as complex decision trees or matrices, remains problematic. Even advanced commercial models like GPT-4(o) struggle with this.
- Accurately interpreting tabular data from Excel files is another area where current AI technology falls short. In order to aid the proper querying of tabular data like Coupa Blueprint and Supplier Grid, it is important to mention the column names as much as possible. Refer to the left sidebar for a list of column names and example questions for your reference.

#### A Call for Your Trust and Caution
We are dedicated to making this chatbot as reliable as possible, but it's important to note that errors can occur. Generative AI operates on probabilities, meaning it cannot achieve 100% accuracy. :red[**Always double-check critical information and apply your expertise when using the chatbot**].

Thank you for your trust and understanding as we work to enhance this tool for our department's benefit.
