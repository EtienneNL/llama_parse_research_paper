##Procurement SOP:## 
The FrieslandCampina Purchasing Policy sets forth comprehensive guidelines for procuring materials and services, grounded in principles of integrity, respect, transparency, fairness, and compliance. This policy applies to all FrieslandCampina employees and suppliers, covering all purchasing activities such as direct and indirect materials, capital expenditures, and travel expenses.
Key components include the “Golden Purchasing Rules,” which consist of 11 rules forming the framework for all purchasing activities. These rules emphasize involving procurement in all external spending, maximizing organizational value, conducting business in line with company values, and segregating duties to prevent conflicts of interest and fraud. Additionally, the policy provides guidelines on personal data protection, segregation of duties, and contract signing.
The policy also incorporates the “Silver Purchasing Rules” for Procurement employees, outlining specific tasks and responsibilities across four main phases: Specification, Sourcing, Contracting, and Procure to Pay. Detailed procedures are available on the Buying Portal via SharePoint.
Compliance with this policy is mandatory, with stricter local exceptions permitted under specific conditions and documented accordingly. The policy encourages employees to report any non-compliance or concerns and stresses adherence to all relevant laws and regulations.
The Standard Operating Procedure and Work Instructions for the Source to Contract (S2C) team further support Category Procurement and Business Procurement, offering services such as e-sourcing management, contract lifecycle management, supplier quality management, counterparty due diligence, financial credibility assessment, compliance and data quality management, reporting, and user training on specific modules.

##Coupa Blueprint and Suppliers Grid:##
    - The Coupa Blueprint table provides a comprehensive overview of procurement categories within dairy manufacturing, detailing the segments, specific categories, and their respective subgroups, alongside assigned buyers for the EMEA and CPA regions. Also S2C buyers are listed accordingly. 
    It includes the ordering channels used in Coupa, the relevance to Candex, the maturity level of each category, and material group classification. 
    Also, it lists information related to slotting, check DPA requirement, SQM scope and explanation for category subgroup (CSG Explanation). Each row represents a unique procurement category with explanations and key identifiers. 
    The GL Account mapping table further enhances financial transparency by linking specific material groups, category subgroups (CSG and CSG Name) to General Ledger (GL) accounts. 
    With respect to the GL Accounts, the table contains info like GL Account number, their corresponding description (GL Account description) and Account assignment category.
    - Complementing this, the Preferred Supplier Grid table lists preferred suppliers (also known as vendors) for various procurement categories within dairy manufacturing. 
    It identifies suppliers by country and provides descriptions (Vendor code and Vendor description), indicating their maturity status and support for Punchout, Catalog, Webform, and SAP Contract features. 
    Each row corresponds to a supplier for a specific category and category subgroup, detailing their capabilities and procurement channel integrations.
    Often the Preferred Supplier Grid table is supplemented by the plant country mapping table, which lists plants by their identification codes (column plant) and their respective countries.
    Each plant is associated with a country code that corresponds to a specific country. For example, plant '0001' is located in Germany, while plant '1000' is in the Netherlands, and plant '1030' is in the United States. 
    These plants serve various regions, contributing to the procurement process by indicating where the preferred suppliers are based, which helps to understand their geographical distribution.
